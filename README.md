# MINECppRAFT

This is my first attempt at creating a Minecraft clone game using C++ and the GLFW3 library. The game currently allows you to generate a world and freely fly around it. In the future, I plan to add physics and a block placing system to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features

- World Generation: The game utilizes the Perlin noise algorithm to procedurally generate a realistic and diverse game world.
- Free Flight: You can navigate the world by flying around using keyboard and mouse controls.
- (Upcoming) Physics: Implementing physics will add realism and interactivity to the game world, enabling interactions with objects and environment.
- (Upcoming) Block Placing System: You will be able to place and remove blocks to build structures and shape the terrain.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- GLFW3 library

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (C++ compiler, GLFW3 library).
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable generated by the compilation process.

## Controls

- Movement: Use keyboard arrow keys or WASD keys to control the direction of movement.
- Look Around: Move the mouse to look around in different directions.
- (Upcoming) Block Placement: Use a specific key or mouse button to place or remove blocks.
